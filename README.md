## ✨ Features

- **🎤 Voice control** — tap the mic and just talk; it transcribes, auto-corrects the text, then generates. With several images attached, say "edit the second one" to target a specific one. Free, browser-native, no extra key.
- **One multimodal input** — type to generate; drag / paste / drop an image to edit; brush a mask to inpaint. Up to 8 reference images, drag to reorder.
- **Works with any OpenAI-compatible endpoint** — `gpt-image`, `flux`, `dall-e`, and most proxy gateways. Bring your own key (BYOK).
- **Streaming, concurrent & cancelable** — watch images render; get all N at once even on endpoints that return one per call; stop anytime.
- **Iterate** — zoomable lightbox (scroll/click to zoom, drag to pan), before/after compare, reroll one, "continue from this", download all, copy prompt.
- **See what really happened** — a meta card shows requested vs **actual** size (flags endpoints that quietly change it) and the endpoint's rewritten prompt.
- **Inspiration library** — a themed prompt gallery (cinematic / scenery / illustration / product / food / architecture); one tap drops the prompt **plus its suggested size & quality**, or copy the prompt alone.
- **✨ AI prompt enhance** — rewrite a rough idea into a polished prompt (optional text endpoint).
- **Custom sizes** — visual ratio presets plus arbitrary W×H up to 4K, aligned to safe ranges.
- **History** — grouped by day, filter by type/time, search, restore a group, and multi-select batch delete/export. Stored locally (IndexedDB).
- **Searchable model picker** — pulls the live `/models` list, image-filtered, with a connection test.
- **i18n** — 中文 / English, instant switch.
- **100% client-side** — no backend, no key relay. Self-hostable static files.

## 🔒 Privacy

Your endpoint, key, model, history and settings live only in your browser (`localStorage` / IndexedDB). The app talks to **your** endpoint directly — there is no server in the middle that sees your key, prompts, or images.

## 🚀 Self-host

This repo is the **built static app** — just serve the files:

```bash
# any static server works
npx serve .
# or drop the folder on Cloudflare Pages / Netlify / Vercel / GitHub Pages / nginx
```

Then open it, click **Settings**, and fill in your endpoint + key + model.
